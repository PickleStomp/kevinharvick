<h3>The Begining</h3>
<p>
  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Harvick">Kevin Harvick</a>
was born in 1975 in Bakersfield, California to parents Mike and JoNell (Walker) Harvick. He has a younger sister, Amber. Harvick began kart racing at an early age, after his parents bought him a go-kart as a kindergarten graduation gift in 1980. Over the next decade Harvick achieved considerable success on the go-kart racing circuit, earning seven national championships and two Grand National championships. In 1992, he started racing late models part-time in the NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Series and he competed there while still in high school.</p>

<h3>NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series</h3>

<p>Harvick made his Craftsman Truck Series (now known as Camping World Truck Series) debut in 1995 at the Mesa Marin Raceway, in his hometown of Bakersfield, where he started and finished 27th in his family-owned No. 72. He drove four races in the No. 72 the next season, his best finish was 11th at Mesa Marin. In 1997, he signed to drive the No. 75 for Spears Motorsports mid-season, posting two eighth-place finishes. He ran a full schedule the next season, posting 3 top-fives and finishing 17th in points.</p>

<h3>NASCAR Busch Series</h3>

<p>On October 23, 1999, Harvick made his first NASCAR Busch Series (now known as NASCAR Xfinity Series) start in the Kmart 200 at the Rockingham Speedway in the No. 2 Chevrolet. He would start 24th and finish 42nd due to engine failure. The race would be his only start in 1999. In 2000, Harvick would sign with Richard Childress Racing to drive the No. 2 Chevrolet for his first full Busch Series season. Despite failing to qualify the second race of the season at Rockingham, Harvick would go on to win the NASCAR Busch Series Rookie of the Year with three wins, eight top-five finishes and 16 top-tens as well as garnering a third-place points finish. Harvick won two Busch Series Championships in 2001 & 2006.</p>

<h3>NASCAR Cup Series Debute (2001)</h3>

<p>For 2001, Richard Childress planned to run Harvick in the No. 2 Chevy in the Busch Series full-time again, while developing him into the Winston Cup Series (now known as the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series) with up to seven races in the No. 30 Chevy. He planned to race Harvick for a full schedule in 2002. The death of Dale Earnhardt on the last lap of the 2001 Daytona 500 changed Childress's plans, and Harvick began his first Cup race the following week in the Dura Lube 400 at Rockingham. Out of respect to Dale Earnhardt, the car's number, No.3, was retired by Childress and Kevin would drive the newly numbered No.29 car.</p>
<p>On March 11, 2001, in the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, only three weeks after Earnhardt's death, Harvick won his first career Winston Cup victory in just his third start by narrowly edging Jeff Gordon. He won the race by only six one-thousandths of a second (.006), proving to be one of the closest finishes in NASCAR history since the introduction of electronic scoring in 1993. After the win, Harvick performed a tire-smoking burnout on the front stretch. Remembering Dale Earnhardt, with three fingers held aloft outside the driver's window, he ran the track backwards as a show of honor and respect. Winning in his third career start, Harvick became the fastest driver to win his first Winston Cup race in the modern era, breaking the record set by Dale Earnhardt Jr. in 2000. At the end of the season, he finished with two victories, six Top 5's, 16 Top 10's, was awarded the NASCAR Rookie of the Year Award, and secured a ninth-place finish in the 2001 points standings.</p>

<h3>NASCAR Cup Series Championship (2014)</h3>

<p>On January 22, 2013, Harvick would leave Richard Childress Racing, after his contract expired, to sign with Stewart-Haas Racing and drive the No.4 car. Harvick and Childress said the parting was mutual and that it was time for Harvick to move on. </p>
<p>In 2014, Harvick, with his new team, would win four races in NASCAR Sprint Cup Series (now known as the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series) which led him to the Championship race at Homestead-Miami in his first season with Stweart-Haas.</p> 
<p>At the final race for the championship at Homestead–Miami Speedway, Harvick was consistent all day long, occasionally battling with Jeff Gordon for the lead. After a late caution, Harvick decided to pit with four tires. Rebounding after restarting outside the top 10, Harvick managed to reach the Top-5, when another caution occurred. Harvick took the lead away from Denny Hamlin, and in the end, held off fellow championship contender Ryan Newman to win the Ford Ecoboost 400 and the Sprint Cup Championship by one position over Newman. This was Kevin Harvick's first NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championship in his career.</p>
